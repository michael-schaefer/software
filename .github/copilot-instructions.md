# Copilot Instructions

This is a documentation-focused repository for exploring software development practices — past, present, and future (especially the impact of AI).

## Repository Purpose

Content lives in `docs/`. There is no application code, build system, or test suite.

## Conventions

- Documents should be written in Markdown.
- Keep content high-level and opinionated rather than tutorial-style.
