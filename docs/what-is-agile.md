# What Is Agile?

Agile is a set of values and principles for building software, born out of frustration with how the industry worked in the 1990s.

## The Problem It Was Reacting To

By the late '90s, most software was built using heavy, plan-driven processes — often called "Waterfall." The pattern looked like this:

1. Spend months gathering requirements and writing specification documents.
2. Hand the spec to architects who design the system on paper.
3. Hand the design to developers who build it.
4. Hand the build to testers who find all the defects.
5. Ship it — often a year or more after the project started.

The result was predictable: by the time software shipped, the business had changed, users wanted something different, and the team had spent months building the wrong thing. Projects ran over budget, over schedule, or got cancelled entirely. The Standish Group's CHAOS reports from this era famously found that the majority of software projects failed or were "challenged."

The deeper issue wasn't incompetence — it was the assumption that you could fully understand a problem before you started solving it. Software development is inherently uncertain. Requirements change. Users don't know what they want until they see it. Technology shifts. Plan-driven processes treated all of this as a failure of discipline, when it was actually a fundamental property of the work.

## The Agile Manifesto (2001)

In February 2001, seventeen software practitioners met at a ski lodge in Snowbird, Utah. They represented a range of "lightweight" methodologies — Extreme Programming, Scrum, Crystal, DSDM, and others — that had been independently emerging as alternatives to heavyweight processes.

They agreed on four value statements:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

And they were careful to note: "while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

## The Twelve Principles

Behind the manifesto are twelve principles. The ones that reveal the original intent most clearly:

- **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.** Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**
- **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**
- **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**

## The Original Intent

The people at Snowbird weren't trying to create a methodology, a certification industry, or a management framework. They were trying to articulate something simpler:

**Software is built by people solving problems under uncertainty. The way to deal with uncertainty is not more upfront planning — it's shorter feedback loops.**

The core ideas:

- **Work in small increments.** Build a little, show it to someone, learn, adjust.
- **Keep teams small and self-organizing.** The people doing the work are closest to the problems and should make the decisions.
- **Prioritize learning over prediction.** Plans are useful, but the ability to change direction is more useful.
- **Measure progress by what works**, not by documents produced, hours logged, or milestones checked off.

Agile was fundamentally about trust and autonomy — trusting developers to figure out how to build things, trusting that requirements will change, and building processes that embrace that reality rather than fighting it.

## What It Was Not

It's worth noting what the original signatories were *not* saying:

- They were not anti-documentation. They were against documentation as a substitute for working software.
- They were not anti-planning. They were against plans that couldn't adapt.
- They were not prescribing specific practices like standups, sprints, or story points. Those came from specific frameworks (mostly Scrum) that existed alongside Agile, not from the manifesto itself.
- They were not creating a product to sell. There were no certifications, no consulting frameworks, no SAFe. That all came later.

The manifesto was a statement of shared values from practitioners, not a process to be imposed on teams from above.
